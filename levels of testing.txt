Unit tests: All positive and negative test cases function level 
Component tests: Test external interfaces of individual components (collection of functions ...). Library and compiled binary level
System tests: Test external interfaces at system level. A system is a collection of components or subsystems.
Performance tests: Tests done at subsystem and system level to verify that at expected production loads , time and resources (mem, cpu and disk) usage are acceptable.
--------------------------

> Unit tests
- Test individual functions 
- A test should be written for each test case for a function (positive and negative test cases)
- Groups of tests can be combined into test suites for better organization.
- Executed in dev environment rather than prod 
- Test execution should be automated
==> unit test structure
// Setup
// Action
// Assert

---------------
TDD workflow ==> loop(red->green->refactor)
